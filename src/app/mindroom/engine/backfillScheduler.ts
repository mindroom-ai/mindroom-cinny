/**
 * CINNY-207 P4.1: BackfillScheduler.
 *
 * A single client-scoped queue that serializes every backfill-shaped
 * network fetch the app initiates: gap fills for the sync tail
 * discontinuities Phase 3 detected, thread-open backfills, thread-seed
 * warm-ups, and the room's own deep-history sweep. The scheduler
 * enforces two invariants that Phase 3 could not:
 *
 *   AC8: no duplicate in-flight jobs per (roomId, threadId, kind).
 *        Enqueuing while a job for the same key is queued or running
 *        returns the same promise identity — the caller gets the
 *        outcome of the in-flight job for free and never fires a
 *        second `/relations` or `/messages` request.
 *
 *   Priority + cap: bands 0-4 (0 = current-room / current-thread
 *        opened; 1 = my-server gap-fills on other rooms; 2 = recently-
 *        active my-server tails; 3 = thread inventory prewarm; 4 =
 *        current-room deep history sweep). Within a band, sort by
 *        `room.getLastActiveTimestamp()` descending so the most
 *        recently active work runs first. At most
 *        `MAX_CONCURRENT_BACKFILL_JOBS` (2) jobs run concurrently.
 *
 * The scheduler is purely a queue + dedup + cap; it does NOT know how
 * to fetch anything. Callers register executor functions when they
 * enqueue (the executor gets an AbortSignal for cooperative teardown)
 * and the scheduler drives them. That way P4.1 lands the invariant
 * before P4.2 wires the first real fetch path.
 *
 * Cooperative abort v1 (see plan §8 Deviations): the SDK's
 * `mx.fetchRelations` and `mx.createMessagesRequest` do NOT accept an
 * AbortSignal today. Executors receive the signal and MUST check
 * `signal.aborted` between batches (typically every 200 events) —
 * cancellation between requests, not mid-request. An `mx.http.
 * authedRequest({abortSignal})` migration is a recorded follow-up.
 *
 * The observability counters (`schedulerEnqueued`, `schedulerDeduped`,
 * `schedulerAborted`, `schedulerCompleted`, `schedulerFailed`) on
 * `window.__MINDROOM_CACHE_PROBE__` are the AC8 evidence handle. A
 * non-abort executor rejection increments `schedulerFailed` — added in
 * the P4 gate fix so a silent job failure is visible from a probe
 * snapshot rather than requiring log spelunking.
